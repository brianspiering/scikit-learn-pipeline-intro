This is an introduction to writing better machine learning code with scikit-learn's pipelines. Scikit-learn is a library of powerful machine learning tools, and scikit-learn pipelines are a way to simplify end-to-end machine learning by systematically chaining those tools together. The result of using pipelines is more readable, robust, and maintainable machine learning code. This content is designed for a person who already has familiarity with machine learning fundamentals and is interested in improving their machine learning skills.

Prerequisites
------

- Working knowledge of common machine learning terms (e.g., regression, classification, and cross-validation)
- Previously trained a basic scikit-learn machine learning model.
